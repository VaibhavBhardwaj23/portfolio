Hi my name is Vaibhav Bhardwaj and I am a frontend web developer. For the last few years I've been devoted myself in the process of learning and applying the knowledge gained into multiple projects and discover a whole new dimension of technology. 
I have never been shy to try new things and learn newer technology to broden the dimension of my skills.
The theme of my portfolio is a comic meme ispired theme to relate it to the amount of tme I spend on social media scrolling through memes.
